rapidcow.github.io has been reset.
I donâ€™t think I have much to host here
with GitHub.  I thank them for the free
service, but it's time to go.

Please refer to rapidcow dot org for
future updates.  I cannot say for sure
that this site won't be deleted entirely.

In the meantime, you might want to hear
about the web revival movement.
